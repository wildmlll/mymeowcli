     Collection ID - statuses
     Fields indexed: ownerId (Ascending), createdAt (Ascending), __name__ (Ascending)
     Query scope - Collection
   - Set up Apple development profile, Xcode, enable signin with Apple.

4. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Build for native**:
