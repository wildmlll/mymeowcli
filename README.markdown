       messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
       appId: "your-app-id"
     };
     ```

4. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Build for mobile**:
   - Add platforms:
     ```bash
     npx cap add ios
     npx cap add android
     ```
   - Build the project:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     npx cap sync
     ```
   - Open in Xcode or Android Studio:
     ```bash
     npx cap open ios
     npx cap open android
     ```

### Firebase Setup
